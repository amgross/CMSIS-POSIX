A partial implementation of the CMSIS‚ÄëRTOS2 API on a POSIX platform for testing and mocking embedded code.

---

## üìñ Overview

CMSIS‚ÄëPOSIX allows you to build and test CMSIS‚ÄëRTOS2‚Äëbased applications on a POSIX system (e.g., Ubuntu Linux) by mapping RTOS2 threads and mutexes to pthreads and related primitives. This is ideal for:

- **Unit testing** and CI pipelines on desktop/server environments  
- **Mocking** RTOS behavior during development  
- Rapid iteration before deploying to real hardware

> **Status:** Partial implementation  
> - Thread creation, deletion, management  
> - Mutex create/lock/unlock  
> - (Other RTOS2 API calls are not yet implemented)

Contributions via Issues or Pull Requests are very welcome‚Äîplease follow the existing coding style (no strict format rules, just be consistent).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- A POSIX‚Äëcompliant OS (tested on Ubuntu Linux)  
- POSIX threads (pthread) support  
- GNU Make (or any POSIX `make`)  
- A C compiler of your choice (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`)
